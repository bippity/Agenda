# Agenda
A simplified, offline, Java version of Trello (https://trello.com/)

Originally made as a final GUI project for Senior year of highschool.

Personally used to take brief notes for courses, To-Do's, etc. Works great for local shared computers in a household.

Data stored inside a local .sqlite file. 
If uploaded onto a cloud service such as Dropbox/Google Drive, the client can be downloaded onto any OS that supports java and tasks will be synced.
